# Takeaway App - A Solo Project

This is a command line app that I have written to practise my OOP and TDD skills. In the app you can (pretend to) order takeaway food.
There is an interactive menu, where you can choose your options.

To run the app, type "ruby lib/run_it.rb" into the terminal after downloading the files.

I followed the test-driving method to ensure the app runs as expected.
I also planned my design carefully and wrote several classes that each fulfil one important job.


_In the end the app can send a confirmation email to the user to tell them at what time they can expect the order. To make this work details from a Twilio account need to be entered into the lib/text_message.rb file. I didn't include my details here, to keep them safe._
